# Writing GitHub CLI Extensions

This repository houses a markdown-based guide for making GitHub CLI extensions.
While GitHub's official docs are a great reference and can get you started,
this guide will help you step-by-step to not only start an extension from
scratch but also teaches the basics of making robust CLI applications in Go and
how to make the most of the [go-gh](https://github.com/cli/go-gh) library.

## Intended audience

People with programming experience and familiarity with using CLI applications.
Go is a scrutable language and any previous programming experience should carry
over to reading and writing basic Go programs, though there is a chapter in
this guide on how to extend the GitHub CLI with languages other than Go.
