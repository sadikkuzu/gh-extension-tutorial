# Shipping your extension

## Publishing releases

Precompiled extensions like the one we're working on are distributed via binary assets on GitHub releases. Because we created our extension with `gh ext create`, our repository already has a GitHub actions workflow installed to help us with releasing. 

Run:

```bash
cat .github/workflows/release.yml
```

and gaze at the YAML.

This workflow file means that when you push to a tag like `v1.0.0`:

- a new release gets added to your repository
- your Go code is compiled for you
- each target platform gets a binary uploaded as a release asset

These steps are performed by the GitHub Action [gh-extension-precompile](https://github.com/cli/gh-extension-precompile).

To see an example release, check out my [gh-chat repository](https://github.com/vilmibm/gh-chat/releases/latest).

It is the existence of a release like this -- complete with binary assets -- that `gh` looks for when you run `gh ext install`.

Go ahead and make a release:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m'it does things'
git push
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
gh run watch
```

Since we did a local install of `gh-lol` for development, remove that before proceeding:

```bash
gh ext remove gh-lol
```

Once you're sure the release is done (`gh release view` is a good way to check), install and run your `gh-lol`:

```bash
gh ext install $YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/gh-lol
gh lol
```

_don't forget to replace $YOUR\_GITHUB\_USERNAME with your GitHub username._

If all has gone well, you should see the usage for `gh lol`.

## Recap

This concludes the Go section of this guide! If that's all you're here for then feel free to peace out.
