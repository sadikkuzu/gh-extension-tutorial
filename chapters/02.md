# Designing our extension

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created and released your own version of a command called `gh lol`. 

`gh-lol` is not something anyone would ever call useful, but it showcases a number of things about both GitHub CLI extensions and CLI apps in general.

I'm going to walk through adding two nested commands to `gh-lol`:

- `gh lol roulette`, a command for closing random things in a repository.
  - accepts a positional argument for what to close ("issue", "pr", or "both")
  - if no arguments specified, interactively ask what resources to pick from
- `gh lol transform`, a command for listing issues and pull requests with various text transformations applied.
  - supports two transforms: [rot13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) and yell (capitalizing all text)
  - accepts `-f`, the name of a transform function to use (ie `rot13` or `yell`.
  - with no flag, interactively asks user what transformation to apply
  - prints results in a table

`gh-lol` will support a new configuration option that can live in `gh`'s config called `RAINBOW`--if enabled, all of its output will be rainbow colored. It will also support a flag across all of its subcommands for selecting a repository to work in.

Since `gh-lol` has multiple subcommands, it will need to use [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for command dispatching and flag handling. For interactivity, it will use [go-survey](https://github.com/go-survey/survey).

That's a lot, so strap on your climbing gear and rappel down into this sinkhole of wonders.
