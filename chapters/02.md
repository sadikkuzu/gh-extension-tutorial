# Designing our extension

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created and released your own version of a command called `gh lol`. 

`gh-lol` is not something anyone would ever call useful, but it showcases a number of things about both GitHub CLI extensions and CLI apps in general.

I'm going to walk through adding two nested commands to `gh-lol`:

- `gh lol spam`, a command for adding a comment to a random issue or pr.
  - accepts an optional argument of a message to use
  - if no arguments specified, interactively ask what message to use
- `gh lol yell`, a command for listing issues but very loudly.
	- accepts `--loud`, an integer representing how loud to yell each issue
  - with no flag, interactively asks user for a loudness value
  - prints results in a table

`gh-lol` will support a new configuration option that can live in `gh`'s config called `suportive`--if enabled, prior to executing any subcommands it will print out a friendly message to the user.

`gh-lol` will also support a flag across all of its subcommands for selecting a repository to work in.

Since `gh-lol` has multiple subcommands, it will need to use [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for command dispatching and flag handling. For interactivity, it will use [go-survey](https://github.com/go-survey/survey).

That's a lot, so strap on your climbing gear and rappel down into this sinkhole of wonders.
