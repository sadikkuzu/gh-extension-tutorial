# Non-Go extensions: Rust example

This short chapter is primarily about how to ship precompiled but non-Go extensions. The actual code of our extension will not be sophisticated.

Though we don't have anything like `go-gh` for other languages, we have at least tried to ease the burden of releasing precompiled, non-Go extensions with our  [gh-extension-precompile](https://github.com/cli/gh-extension-precompile) action.

Though I'm using Rust in this chapter, the principles will allow to languages like C++, Haskell, or Chicken Scheme too.

## Prerequisites

You'll need the Rust compiler installed. Their [install page]()https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) can hook you up.

## Create your extension

Move to a directory where you're comfortable creating a new git repository, then run:

```bash
gh ext create
```

- for **extension name**, say **hello**
- for **What kind of extension**, choose **Other precompiled**

Then:

```bash
cd gh-hello
touch gh-hello.rs
```

Open up `gh-hello.rs` in your editor and fill it with:

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("hello there")
}
```

_can you tell I'm not a Rustacean?_

Compile and locally install the extension for testing:

```bash
rustc gh-hello.rs
gh install .
gh hello
```

`hello there` should be printed out.

Though `gh ext create` added a `release.yml` to `.github/workflows/release.yml`, it won't actually help ship this extension until `script/build.sh` is filled in.

`script/build.sh` is called from the action to prepare your release assets. If you run `cat script/build.sh`, it'll give you a hint as to how to proceed: _It should build binaries in dist/<platform>-<arch>[.exe] as needed._

Let's do that. Open up `script/build.sh` and make it look like:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

mkdir -p dist
rustc --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -o dist/linux-amd64 gh-hello.rs
```

_ !!! _ A potential point of frustration and confusion here is architecture names. Rust and Go use different names for architectures (eg `x86_64` vs `amd64`). When `gh` installs a precompiled extension it looks for binaries based on the **Go** naming scheme.

TODO: try out https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rust-toolchain
  - get darwin/windows toolchains in
  - add targeted rustc invocations
  - update this to add action to release.yml
  - test it out
