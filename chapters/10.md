# Non-Go extension: Bash

GitHub CLI extensions not only don't need Go, they don't even need to be pre-compiled.

You might want to ship an extension in a language like Bash, Python, or Ruby.

There are two downsides to this approach:

1. The user installing your extension needs to have the correct version of the correct interpreter installed locally (though with Bash this isn't a huge risk)
2. You lose access to `go-gh`

However, there are plenty of valid reasons to do this, too, including:

- you have some existing script you want to ship using `gh ext install`
- you're making something for a client that heavily relies on some interpreted language
- there's tooling in some interpreted language whose benefit outweighs that of `go-gh` for your extension
- your release flow is just `git` pushes
- you're just an absolute God of Bash

For this example we'll use Bash to make a short extension called `gh-whoami`.

## Create your extension

If you're still in your `gh-lol` directory, get out of there and go someplace where you're ok with making a new git repository.

Once you're there, run:

```bash
gh ext create
```

- For **extension name**, say **whoami**
- For **What kind of extension**, choose **Script**

Then:

```bash
cd gh-whoami
gh ext install .
gh whoami
```

You should see `Hello gh-whoami!` printed.

## Putting your extension on GitHub

Create a repository on GitHub for this little guy:

```bash
gh repo create
```

- Choose **Push an existing local repository to GitHub**
- Choose the default (**.**) for repository path
- Choose the default (**gh-whoami**) for repository name
- Choose the default (you) for repository owner
- Put whatever for description (empty string is fine)
- Select either **Public** or **Private** for visibility; if you're doing this live I recommend **Public** so I can help you more easily
- For the final three prompts, accept defaults


## Adding behavior

Crack open the `gh-whoami` file in your editor and erase everything below `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. Then, add:

```bash

set -e
QUERY='
  query {
    viewer {
      login
    }
  }
'

TEMPLATE='
  {{- printf .data.viewer.login }}
'

exec gh api graphql -f query="${QUERY}" --template="${TEMPLATE}"
```

This code:

- Sets up a GraphQL query
- Creates a Go template (you thought you could escape Go but we're pulling you right back in)
- Calls out to `gh`, using the query and template to get some information and format it for the user

Run it to verify it prints out your GitHub username:

```bash
gh whoami
```

## Shipping

Interpreted extensions don't require anything beyond a `git push` to be available for others to install.

Run:

```bash
git add gh-whoami
git commit -m'does the thing'
git push
gh ext remove whoami
gh ext install $YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/gh-whoami
gh whoami
```

_Don't forget to change $YOUR\_GITHUB\_USERNAME to your GitHub username_

You should see the same output as before; but now you're running a copy of your bash extension as installed from GitHub instead of your local computer.

# Recap

Extensions in an interpreted language are a great option for something lightweight. You might be surprised at how powerful `gh` can be for extensions even without the help of `go-gh`.
