## gh ext create

In your terminal, run:

```bash
gh ext create
```

- For extension name, say **lol**.
- For extension kind, say **Go**.

Run:

```bash
cd gh-lol
gh extension install .
gh lol
```

_ !!! _ Don't forget the `.` after `gh extension install`

If you're doing this tutorial live, let me know if you don't see something like:

```
hi world, this is the gh-lol extension!
running as vilmibm
```

## Putting your extension on GitHub

So it's easier to learn how to release extensions later on, take the time now to get your new extension on GitHub:

```bash
gh repo create
```

- Choose **Push an existing local repository to GitHub**
- Choose the default (**.**) for repository path
- Choose the default (**gh-lol**) for repository name
- Choose the default (you) for repository owner
- Put whatever for description (empty string is fine)
- Select either **Public** or **Private** for visibility; if you're doing this live I recommend **Public** so I can help you more easily
- For the final three prompts, accept defaults
